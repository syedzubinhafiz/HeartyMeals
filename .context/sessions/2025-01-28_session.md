# Session Log - Mock Data Creation for Demo

## Focus

**Primary Focus**: Create comprehensive mock data for demo (TASK-003)  
**Secondary Focus**: Implement web-search for realistic images

## Context

Starting session after successful completion of authentication system (TASK-002). Database infrastructure is established and authentication is functional. Now focusing on creating meaningful mock data including food components, recipe collections, meal logging data, and educational content. User suggested using web-search for realistic recipe images.

**Key Context from Previous Session**:
- Authentication system fully implemented and tested
- Database schema exists with all tables created
- JWT authentication working with custom email/password system
- Ready to populate database with realistic demo data

## Progress

### TASK-003: Create Comprehensive Mock Data for Demo (In Progress)

**Status**: Active - Demo users created, role routing fixed

#### Completed:
- ✅ Created demo user accounts with authentication
- ✅ Fixed role-based routing issue in frontend
- ✅ Identified admin dashboard functionality

#### Current Status:
- Demo accounts working: Admin, Patient, Dietitian
- Role-based routing partially working
- Admin dashboard exists with full functionality

#### Current Understanding:
- Need comprehensive mock data across all entities
- Focus on realistic, meaningful data for demo purposes
- Food components, recipes, and meal logging are all important
- Will use web-search for realistic recipe images
- Target: 100+ food components, 50+ recipes, realistic user data

#### Implementation Plan:
1. Create demo user accounts with proper authentication
2. Generate comprehensive food components library
3. Build diverse recipe collection with web-searched images
4. Create realistic meal logging history
5. Add fluid logging data
6. Generate educational content
7. Verify all data relationships

## Decisions

### Key Decisions Made:

1. **Image Strategy**: 
   - **Decision**: Use web-search to find realistic food images
   - **Rationale**: User suggestion provides better visual appeal than generic placeholders
   - **Impact**: Enhanced demo presentation, more realistic user experience

## Self-Improvement

### Applied Recommendations from Previous Session:

- **Early Verification** [REC-001]: Will verify database connectivity before starting mock data generation
- **Parallel Development** [REC-003]: Will work on backend data seeding while considering frontend display needs
- **Progressive Testing** [REC-004]: Will test data creation incrementally rather than all at once

### Success Patterns to Apply:
- **DTO-first approach**: Create proper DTOs for data seeding operations
- **Template-based development**: Reuse existing entity structures for consistent data creation

## Dependencies

### Completed Dependencies:
- TASK-001: Database setup and configuration ✅
- TASK-002: Authentication system implementation ✅

### Current Requirements:
- Database connectivity confirmed
- Authentication endpoints functional
- All entity schemas available for data population

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. Verify database connectivity and schema status
2. Create demo user accounts with authentication
3. Start food components library creation
4. Begin recipe collection with web-searched images

### Session Goals:
- Complete demo user account creation
- Populate food components library (target: 100+ items)
- Create initial recipe collection (target: 20+ recipes)
- Establish realistic meal logging patterns

## Notes

### Session Scope:
- Focus on quality over quantity for demo data
- Ensure data relationships are properly maintained
- Create realistic user scenarios for effective demos
- Use web-search strategically for high-impact recipe images

### Technical Considerations:
- All data must work with existing authentication system
- Nutrition calculations must be accurate for demo credibility
- Meal logging data should show realistic eating patterns
- Educational content should be relevant to heart health

### Dietitian Role Backlog Decision:
- User requested to backlog dietitian dashboard functionality (TASK-004)
- Core functionality needs to be working first before role specialization
- Dietitians currently redirect to patient home page as temporary solution
- Will implement dedicated dietitian interface once core features are stable
