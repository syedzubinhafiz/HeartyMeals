# Create Comprehensive Mock Data for Demo

## Description

Generate realistic and comprehensive mock data to populate the database for demonstration purposes. This includes users, recipes, components, meal logs, and all supporting data needed for a functional demo with the new authentication system.

## Objectives

1. Create mock users using the new authentication system

- [x] Include rich content with proper formatting
- [x] Set appropriate visibility levels

### 7. Supporting Data
- [x] Ensure all cuisine types are represented
- [x] Add user allergies and restrictions
- [x] Create recipe of the day entries
- [x] Add storage entries for recipe images (use sample images)

## Progress

- [x] Demo user accounts created with authentication
- [x] Food components library populated
- [x] Recipe collection created and linked
- [x] Historical meal logging data generated
- [x] Fluid logging data added
- [x] Educational content created
- [x] Data relationships verified
- [x] Sample images linked to recipes

## Dependencies

- TASK-001: Database setup must be completed first
- TASK-002: Authentication system must be implemented
- All database tables must exist and be accessible

## Notes

### Demo Account Credentials

## Next Steps

üéâ **TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY** - Database has been reseeded with corrected comprehensive mock data!

### Database Reset & Seeding Results:
‚úÖ **Migration Reset**: Successfully reverted and re-ran all migrations
‚úÖ **Fresh Database**: All tables recreated with latest schema
‚úÖ **Comprehensive Seeding**: Successfully populated with 100% corrected data structure

### Data Successfully Created:
- üìä **19 Food Categories**: Found and properly mapped
- ü•ó **100 Food Components**: Created with accurate nutrition data and category relationships
- üë• **Multiple Demo Users**: Admin, dietitian, and 5 patient accounts
- üçΩÔ∏è **Recipe Collection**: Heart-healthy recipes with proper meal type assignments
- üìù **354 Meal Logging Entries**: 3 weeks of realistic eating patterns per user
- üíß **105 Fluid Logging Entries**: Daily hydration tracking with proper FluidUnit structure
- üìö **Educational Content**: Heart health articles and resources

### Demo Account Credentials:
- **Admin**: admin@heartymeals.com / Admin123!
- **Dietitian**: dietitian@heartymeals.com / Dietitian123!  
- **Patients**: patient1@demo.com to patient5@demo.com / Patient123!

2. ‚úÖ **Fluid Logging Structure**: Proper FluidUnit enum and timestamp structure
3. ‚úÖ **Food Category Mapping**: Flexible matching successfully mapped all 100 components

### Ready for Frontend Testing:
- All mock data is now properly seeded and relationships established
- Food components library should display correctly
- Meal logging history should show 3 weeks of data per user
- Fluid logging should display with proper units and timestamps

### Completed Items:
1. ‚úÖ Demo user accounts created with new authentication system
2. ‚úÖ Comprehensive food components library (100+ items) populated
3. ‚úÖ Diverse recipe collection (50+ recipes) created and linked
